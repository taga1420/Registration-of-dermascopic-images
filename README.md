# Registration-of-dermascopic-images

Algorithm for registration of dermascopic images. Registration is required when images are captured at different times, and in this
way, a direct comparison is possible for monitoring the evolution and quantification on any significant changes. It was used a probablistic method for point set registration named Coherent Point Drift. The input are accurate binary masks of the skin lesion area.
